# TunInvest API - IT325 Web Service

TunInvest API Project represents my final project for the IT325 Web Service course. 
The TunInvest API is designed to allow Tunisian citizens to report issues, needs, and potential enhancements in their local communities, as well as provide a means for decision makers to identify and address these issues.
This API was developed using FastAPI and Python, and utilizes a PostgreSQL database managed with SQLAlchemy and Alembic.
Security measures include OAuth2 JWT and password hashing for user authentication. 
Testing was conducted using Postman, and version control was managed with Git and GitHub.
The API was containerized using Docker and An attempt was made to deploy the API using Render.
The goal of this API is to improve the quality of life for Tunisian citizens and contribute to the development of the country through better communication and understanding of community issues.
